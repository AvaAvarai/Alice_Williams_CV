        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            I am a recent graduate with a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, working as an AI/ML Research Assistant, AI Ed-Tech Startup Founder, and AI/ML Consultant.<br><br>
        
            My work focuses on visualization-driven artificial intelligence, merging computation with human intuition to create transparent, interactive, and trustworthy AI systems. I have developed methods in synthetic data generation, boosting classification models, and multidimensional clustering, alongside advancing feature engineering, knowledge discovery, and classification refinement. My approach bridges the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world impact, ensuring AI models are both interpretable and high-performing.<br><br>
        
            With experience spanning system administration, full-stack software development, and academic AI/ML research, I approach every challenge with a mindset of deconstructing complex problems, building modular tools, and verifying every result reproducibly.
