            <p>"<i>I believe in intuition and inspiration. Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution. It is, strictly speaking, a real factor in scientific research.</i>”</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a senior double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, blending rigorous research with hands-on engineering. As a Research Assistant, AI Ed-Tech Startup Founder, and AI/ML Consultant, I thrive at the intersection of theory and application.<br><br>

            My work focuses on pushing the boundaries of visualization-driven artificial intelligence, merging computation with human intuition to create more transparent, interactive, and trustworthy AI systems. I have pioneered methods in synthetic data generation, boosting classification models, and multidimensional clustering, alongside advancing feature engineering, knowledge discovery, and classification refinement. My approach bridges the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world impact, ensuring AI models are both interpretable and high-performing.<br><br>

            With experience spanning system administration, full-stack development, and academic AI/ML research, I approach every challenge with a hacker's mindset—deconstructing complex problems, building modular tools, and refusing to accept black-box models at face value.
